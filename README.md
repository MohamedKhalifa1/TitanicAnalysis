# Titanic Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the Titanic dataset using various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, and decision tree. Additionally, the analysis includes data visualization and reporting using Tableau, as well as data overview and cleaning using SQL.

## Overview

The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset used in machine learning and data analysis. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographic information and whether they survived or not.

## Contents

1. **Data Overview and Cleaning (SQL):** The SQL scripts used to overview and clean the dataset are located in the `sql` directory.

2. **Machine Learning Models:**
    - **Logistic Regression:** The Jupyter Notebook `04_modeling.ipynb` contains the implementation and analysis of logistic regression.
    - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** The Jupyter Notebook `04_modeling.ipynb` contains the implementation and analysis of KNN.
    - **Random Forest:** The Jupyter Notebook `04_modeling.ipynb` contains the implementation and analysis of the random forest algorithm.
    - **Decision Tree:** The Jupyter Notebook `04_modeling.ipynb` contains the implementation and analysis of the decision tree algorithm.

3. **Tableau Reporting:** The Tableau visualization report is available in the `tableau` directory.

## Tableau Reporting

The Tableau visualization report provides insights into the Titanic dataset through interactive visualizations. It includes exploratory data analysis, demographics of passengers, survival rates, and more.
